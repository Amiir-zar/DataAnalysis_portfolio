# The Flights_Delay_Dashboard_with_Bokeh

The Flights_Delay_Dashboard_with_Bokeh project serves as a testament to my proficiency in designing and developing interactive dashboards using the powerful Bokeh library. 
<br><br>

## Description
The Flights_Delay_Dashboard_with_Bokeh project involved creating an interactive dashboard using the Bokeh library to visualize and analyze flight delay data. The dashboard allowed users to explore patterns and trends in flight delays, including factors such as airline and delay time. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to leverage Bokeh's features and functionality to create a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard that effectively presents and analyzes flight delay data.

# Studen_performance_project

 By conducting an in-depth examination of student scores , I showcased my proficiency in extracting meaningful insights from data and effectively communicating them through visualizations. 
<br><br>
## Description

The Student_Performance_Project involved the analysis of student scores in three subjects: Math, Writing, and Reading. 
This project showcases my proficiency in handling and evaluating student performance data across multiple subjects.
By examining the scores in these three areas, I aimed to gain insights into individual student strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of student achievement.
This project highlights my strong analytical skills and ability to leverage data visualization tools to gain valuable insights into student performance across different subjects.
