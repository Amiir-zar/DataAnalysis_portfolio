# Studen_performance_project

 By conducting an in-depth examination of student scores , I showcased my proficiency in extracting meaningful insights from data and effectively communicating them through visualizations. 

## Description

The Student_Performance_Project involved the analysis of student scores in three subjects: Math, Writing, and Reading. 
This project showcases my proficiency in handling and evaluating student performance data across multiple subjects.
By examining the scores in these three areas, I aimed to gain insights into individual student strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of student achievement.
This project highlights my strong analytical skills and ability to leverage data visualization tools to gain valuable insights into student performance across different subjects.
